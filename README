NAME
    Org::Export::HTML - Export Org document to HTML

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
     use Org::Export::HTML qw(export_org_to_html);

     export_org_to_html(
         source_file  => 'todo.org', # or source_str
         target_file  => 'todo.html',
         html_title   => 'My Todo List',
         include_tags => [...],
         exclude_tags => [...],
     );

DESCRIPTION
    Export Org format to HTML. Currently very barebones; this module is more
    of a proof-of-concept for Org::Parser. For any serious exporting,
    currently you're better-off using Emacs' org-mode HTML export facility.

    This module uses Log::Any logging framework.

FUNCTIONS
    None is exported by default, but they can be.

  export_org_to_html(%args) -> [STATUS_CODE, ERR_MSG, RESULT]
    Export Org document to HTML.

    Returns a 3-element arrayref. STATUS_CODE is 200 on success, or an error
    code between 3xx-5xx (just like in HTTP). ERR_MSG is a string containing
    error message, RESULT is the actual result.

    Arguments ("*" denotes required arguments):

    *   exclude_tags => *array*

        Exclude trees that carry one of these tags.

        After 'include_tags' is evaluated, all subtrees that are marked by
        any of the exclude tags will be removed from export.

    *   html_title => *str*

        HTML document title, defaults to source_file.

    *   include_tags => *array*

        Include trees that carry one of these tags.

        Works like Org's 'org-export-select-tags' variable. If the whole
        document doesn't have any of these tags, then the whole document
        will be exported. Otherwise, trees that do not carry one of these
        tags will be excluded. If a selected tree is a subtree, the heading
        hierarchy above it will also be selected for export, but not the
        text below those headings.

    *   source_file => *str*

        Source Org file to export.

    *   source_str => *str*

        Alternatively you can specify Org string directly.

    *   target_file => *str*

        HTML file to write to.

        If not specified, HTML string will be returned.
